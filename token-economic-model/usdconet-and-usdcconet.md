# $CONET and $cCONET

CoNET Network is a fully open-source project driven by the community, adhering to the principles of Bitcoin. \
CoNET Network is deploying two different tokens $CONET and $cCONET , they will have different utilities.\
The total supply of $CONET is 1 billion.\
\


## Utilities & Economy

### Utilities

The CoNET economy includes two tokens: $CONET and $cCONET. $CONET is built on a chain to be announced and $cCONET is built on CoNET Network. The only way to mint $cCONET is to burn your $CONET. $cCONET acts as the central currency of the CoNET Network

 $CONET can be :\
\-tradable on exchanges\
\-converted to $cCoNET via burn and vice versa via burn and mint mechanism

/ $cCONET is used for Dapp transactions\
 Users accessing dApps on the CoNET network pay fees to gain a decentralised, zero-trust, secure, and reliable open network communication experience provided by the underlying protocol

 $cCONET is used for protocol governance.#\
 The development of the CoNET protocol is driven and managed by a decentralised community

\- $cCONET is used for mining\
 In the initial phase, a dual proof-of-time and proof-of-bandwidth mechanism is implemented    to establish community engagement and attract more participants

 $cCONET is used for staking\
 Users will be able to stake to receive rewards and to partake in governance

 $cCONET is used as a reward mechanism\
 The $cCONET token will be used to reward ecosystem participants to drive demand.

## Economy&#x20;

### Actors:

1. PU - Protocol Users
2. M â€“ Miners
3. RN â€“ Relay Nodes
4. S - Stakers
5. CN - Conet Network&#x20;
6. Ex â€“ Exchange

## Economy Flow

### Phase 1

Phase 1 begins with no tradeable token and CNTP Points. It consists of a Miners Pool, a referral program and a community incentive programme. The goal of phase 1 is to onboard users to the CoNET Ecosystem.

PU can purchase a guardian node and receive CNTP Points as a reward

### Phase 2

Phase 2 begins with CNTP points being converted to $CONET tokens. For more info on the conversion from CNTP to $CONET tokens please see the economic policy section of the token paper.

**The economy in phase 2 consists of the following flow :**\
\
b= PU purchase $CONETon a Dex or Cex.Y\
m= PU burn their $CONET to receive $cCoNET via the Conet native bridge and vice versa to change their $cCoNET to $CONE6 I= PU use $cCoNET for Dapp transactions on the Conet Network to pay for services.

**Miners**

k= M lock up their $cCoNET to purchase Guardian nodes to take part in mining. In return they receive $cCoNET as a reward.

**Relay Node**

9= Relay Node Participants register, act as relay nodes, and connect to the CoNET network to prove the online time of their devices.

**Stakers**

g= S can stake $cCONET to boost their mining rewards and to receive $cCONET rewards.

**AlK**

= M, S, and PU all receive access to take part in governance on the CoNET network and ecosystem. â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨â€¨
