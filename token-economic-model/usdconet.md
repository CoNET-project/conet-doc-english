# $CONET

CoNET is a fully open-source project driven by the community, adhering to the principles of Bitcoin. The total supply of $CONET is 1 billion.

The $CONET token will play the following key roles in the development of the CONET project:

1. **Mining Rewards:** In the initial phase, a dual proof-of-time and proof-of-bandwidth mechanism is implemented to establish community engagement and attract more participants.
2. **Mining Staking Accelerated Rewards:** In the initial stage, liquidity mining provided by participants contributes to the accumulation of power for the CONET community takeoff.
3. **CONET Network Usage Fees:** Users accessing dApps on the CONET network pay fees to gain a decentralized, zero-trust, secure, and reliable open network communication experience provided by the underlying protocol.
4. **Mining Revenue:** As CONET matures and more third-party dApps join, increased network traffic leads to a significant increase in mining revenue. Mining rewards gradually decrease, and the CONET flywheel enters a positive cycle.
5. **Protocol Governance:** The development of the CONET protocol is driven and managed by a decentralized community.

Unlocking Periods: Early investors have an unlocking period of 18 months with linear release, while the core team's unlocking period is 3 years.
