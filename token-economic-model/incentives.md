# Incentives

**Mining Economic Model:**

* **Total Issuance:**
  * 6 billion tokens are allocated for mining rewards, accounting for 60% of the total issuance.
* **Mining Output:**
  * Mining output occurs in cycles, with each cycle lasting 180 days.
  * Output decreases by 20% at the end of each cycle.
  * In the first cycle, mining output represents 18% of the total output, i.e., 1.08 billion, and decreases accordingly in subsequent cycles.
* **Boost Mechanism:**
  * Boost is an acceleration mechanism for mining, achieved by staking a significant amount.
  * Three different computing power mechanisms:
    * Regular Mining Coefficient: 1
    * Boost: 6
    * BoostLP: 12
* **Three Mining Pools:**
  * Regular Mining Pool: 5% of daily output is distributed as mining rewards through shared bandwidth.
  * Boost Pool: Users need to stake for 90 days to activate the Boost acceleration mechanism, increasing their mining rate. During the staking period, the staked amount cannot be withdrawn. The more staked, the higher the proportion of mining rewards. Boost Pool represents 30% of daily output.
  * BoostLP Pool: Double rewards. Encourages users to stake for higher output. By injecting liquidity and locking it for 120 days, users gain BoostLP mining acceleration. Similar to Boost Pool, the staked amount cannot be withdrawn during the staking period, and the more staked, the higher the proportion of mining rewards. BoostLP Pool represents 60% of daily output.
* **Compute Power Ranking Rewards:**
  * 5% of daily output is rewarded to the top 100 contributors in the global computing power rankings. Calculated based on the highest quantity of mined blocks among the top 100 wallet addresses.
* **Invitation Mechanism:**
  * Direct Referrer: Participants receive a unique referral link upon joining the mining pool. If someone joins mining through this link, the referrer earns an additional 20% bonus based on the referred person's earnings (this is an extra bonus and does not affect the referrer's income). This continues as long as the referred users keep earning points, leading to a continuous growth in bonuses.
  * Sub-referrer: When a referred person (sub-referrer) brings in additional users, both the referred person and the direct referrer receive a 20% additional bonus based on the sub-referrer's earnings. Additionally, the direct referrer earns 10% of the sub-referrer's rewards (extra bonus, not affecting the sub-referrer's income). This situation continues indefinitely as long as the sub-referrer earns extra points, benefiting both the direct referrer and the sub-referrer.
