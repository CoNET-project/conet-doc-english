**Mining Economic Model:**

Mining output occurs in cycles, with each cycle lasting 180 days, and a 20% reduction in output per cycle. In the first cycle, mining accounts for 18% of the total output, and this percentage decreases with each subsequent cycle.

**Boost Mechanism:**

Boost is an acceleration mechanism for mining. Users can boost their mining speed by staking a sufficient amount of tokens. There are different types of mining pools:

1. **Regular Mining Pool:** Shares mining rewards based on shared bandwidth, constituting 5% of the daily output.
2. **Boost Pool:** Users need to stake for 90 days to activate the Boost acceleration mechanism, accelerating their mining rate. The Boost pool constitutes 30% of the daily output.
3. **BoostLP Pool:** Provides double rewards. Users stake to gain higher output, and by injecting liquidity and locking LP for 90 days, they receive BoostLP mining acceleration. The BoostLP pool constitutes 58% of the daily output.

**Compute Power Mechanism Coefficients:**

* Regular Mining Coefficient: 1
* Boost Seed Node Coefficient: 6
* Boost Super Node Coefficient: 12
* Boost Liquidity LP Coefficient: 24

These coefficients indicate that, at the same time, under the condition of 1 $CONET for regular mining, a Boost Seed Node with a coefficient of 6 could produce 6 times the output, equivalent to 6 $CONET.

**Factors Affecting Mining Output Weight:**

* Online duration
* Number of referrals
* Mining method

**Compute Power Ranking Rewards:**

5% of the daily output is rewarded to the top 100 contributors in the network's compute power ranking. Calculated based on the wallets with the most mining in the entire network.

**Lucky Blocks:**

2% of the total daily mining output is dedicated to "Lucky Blocks," providing participants with an exciting opportunity to share additional earnings.

**Referral Mechanism:**

* Direct Referrals: Participants receive a unique referral link. If someone joins mining using the link, the referrer gets a 20% bonus of the referred person's earnings continuously.
* Secondary Referrals: When the referred person brings in others (secondary referrals), both the referred person and the secondary referrer receive a 20% bonus on the secondary referral's earnings. The direct referrer also gets a 10% bonus on the secondary referrer's earnings. This continues indefinitely, benefiting the direct referrer as long as the secondary referrer earns additional points.
