# Community Incentive Program

## Earning CNTP through Mining and the CoNETian Minigame

CoNET’s Community Incentive Program offers users multiple ways to engage and earn CNTP (CoNET Points), which serve as valuable rewards within our ecosystem. Whether you are participating in our decentralized platform or enjoying the CoNETian Minigame, you can earn CNTP, contributing to CoNET's growing decentralized infrastructure.

### Overview of the Community Incentive Program

The program rewards users for their active participation in the CoNET network, and CNTP is central to this initiative. CNTP points are not just digital rewards—they are blockchain-based assets securely stored in the user’s wallet and fully transparent.

**How to Earn CNTP**

CoNET provides several methods for earning CNTP:

1. **Mining via the Platform and Extension**:
   * **Mining on the Platform**: By joining CoNET’s platform, users can engage in our mining system, contributing their resources (bandwidth, CPU) to the network and earning CNTP in return. This helps power CoNET’s decentralized infrastructure while rewarding users for their contribution.
   * **Extension Mining**: Users can also install the CoNET browser extension, allowing them to mine CNTP as they browse, seamlessly participating in CoNET's network with no special setup required. It’s an easy way to mine while browsing the web and earn valuable CNTP points.
2. **The CoNETian Minigame on Telegram**:
   * For a more interactive experience, users can play the CoNETian Minigame, available on Telegram. The game not only provides a fun way to engage with the CoNET ecosystem but also allows players to mine CNTP tokens through daily gameplay.
   * Completing daily tasks, missions, and claims within the game allows participants to earn rewards, such as tickets, CNTP, keys, and other in-game assets.

### Decentralized Rewards System

* **Blockchain Integration**: CNTP tokens are issued via smart contracts, ensuring a transparent and secure record of all tokens mined or earned.
* **Direct Wallet Management**: Tokens are deposited directly into the user’s blockchain wallet, giving users full ownership of their assets.
* **Fair and Transparent**: By recording all rewards on-chain, the program ensures a transparent and decentralized distribution of CNTP tokens.

### Conversion to $CONET Tokens

As we move toward the Token Generation Event (TGE), CNTP points will be convertible to $CONET tokens at a ratio to be announced prior to the TGE. This means that your participation in mining or gameplay today will have real value when the $CONET token launches.

### Why Choose CoNET’s Community Incentive Program?

* **Multiple Ways to Earn**: Whether through mining on the platform, using the browser extension, or playing the CoNETian Minigame, there are many ways to earn CNTP.
* **Decentralized and Transparent**: All rewards are secured via blockchain, ensuring that the reward process is fair and verifiable.
* **User Ownership**: CNTP tokens are managed directly in the user’s wallet, offering full control and ownership of their rewards.

#### Conclusion

The CoNET Community Incentive Program empowers users to participate and earn CNTP in a decentralized and transparent way. Whether you choose to mine on our platform or play the CoNETian Minigame, you’ll be rewarded with valuable CNTP tokens, which will soon convert to $CONET and offer even more utility within the CoNET ecosystem.
