# The CoNETian Miniapp

### The CoNETian isn't just a game – it's your gateway to joining the revolutionary CoNET ecosystem.

\
We've developed this mining mini-game on Telegram and on Browser as an innovative way to let everyone participate in our decentralized network.

**Why did we build this game?** \
We created The CoNETian to make it easy for anyone, anywhere in the world, to join our project. \
By playing this game, you’re not just having fun – you’re actively participating in a decentralized future.

The CoNETian uses Blockchain technology for rewards distribution, emphasizing our commitment to decentralization.

As you play,in this testnet phase, you’ll start mining and earning $CNTP. \
We’re also introducing exciting features like box openings for bigger prizes and more interactive gameplay. \
\
This isn’t just about rewards – it’s about giving you a chance to be part of something bigger.



\
**What’s Next?** \
\
Soon, this game will allow players to mine in our DePIN network simply by sharing bandwidth, all while enjoying the gameplay.\
As we prepare to launch our main-net, The CoNETian will evolve, allowing users to contribute to and benefit from our decentralized infrastructure just by playing and sharing their resources from their phone.

No complicated setups – just your mobile device and the game.



Welcome to The CoNETian and the new era of online participation!
