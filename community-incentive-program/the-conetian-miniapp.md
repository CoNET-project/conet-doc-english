# The CoNETian Miniapp

### The CoNETian Miniapp: Your Gateway to Decentralized Participation

The CoNETian isn’t just a game – it’s your access point to CoNET’s decentralized ecosystem. Built for both Telegram and Browser, this mini-game allows everyone, anywhere in the world, to join CoNET’s revolutionary network in a fun and easy way.

#### Why Did We Build The CoNETian?

We created The CoNETian to offer an engaging and simple way for users to get involved in our decentralized project. By playing, you’re not just having fun—you’re actively contributing to the future of decentralization.\
Blockchain-powered rewards are at the core of the game. As you play, you’re rewarded in $CNTP tokens through a decentralized system, highlighting our commitment to privacy, security, and decentralization.

#### Features:

* Daily Claim: Players can claim daily prizes, and by completing missions every day, you unlock a special mystery prize every Sunday.
* Daily Missions & Social Tasks: Complete missions to earn in-game rewards and complete social tasks with our partner projects for more prizes.
* In-game Assets: You can collect and send in-game items like tickets, keys, skins, and $CNTP tokens to enhance your gameplay.
* API for Social Tasks: We’ve developed our own decentralized API for social tasks, ensuring that everything stays private, secure, and transparent while interacting with partner ecosystems.

#### Earn While You Play

In the testnet phase, players are already mining and earning $CNTP tokens. This miniapp also offers box openings, interactive gameplay, and exciting rewards that keep evolving. It’s not just about earning; it's about being part of a decentralized movement.

#### What’s Coming Next?

As we approach the mainnet launch, The CoNETian will become a gateway to our DePIN network. Players will not only mine tokens but also contribute to the decentralized infrastructure by sharing bandwidth, CPU, and storage resources—all while playing.

Through social tasks, gameplay, and decentralized mining, you'll help grow and secure the CoNET network—all from your phone or browser.

#### Welcome to the Future of Decentralized Fun!

With The CoNETian, everyone can participate in the decentralized economy, contributing to and benefiting from CoNET’s mission to build a secure and private internet.
