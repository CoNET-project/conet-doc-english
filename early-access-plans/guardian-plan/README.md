# Guardian Plan



**Introduction to the Guardian Plan**

Welcome to the Guardian Plan, your opportunity to join the Internet Revolution and become a pivotal part of a secure and free new Internet. As a Guardian, you are not just a participant but a key stakeholder in the CoNET ecosystem. Guardians are essential members, overseeing, governing, and sustaining the long-term development of CoNET, which aims to decentralize and secure Internet infrastructure.

**What is a Guardian?**

Guardians are the backbone of the CoNET network, operating Supernodes that validate and relay network transactions. These Supernodes are a limited and crucial infrastructure, with only 20,000 available globally. Operating a Supernode allows Guardians to hold significant governance power within the network, influence decisions, and participate actively in the CoNET community.

**Importance of Guardians**

Guardians play a critical role in:

* **Network Governance**: Participate in the decision-making processes that define the network's future.
* **Infrastructure Stability**: Maintain the operational stability and security of the CoNET network through Supernodes.
* **Ecosystem Growth**: Help expand the CoNET ecosystem, leading to a more robust and decentralized Internet.

**Benefits of Being a Guardian**

1. **Super Node Operation**: Operate a part of the network's core infrastructure with enhanced mining capabilities and automatic operations.
2. **Revenue Sharing**:
   * Earn a share from the overall CoNET ecosystem revenue.
   * Receive dividends from the operations of the CoNET network.
3. **Exclusive Access and Rewards**:
   * Use the DCPN (Decentralized Private Network) for free.
   * Receive the largest individual CoNET Official airdrop in history.
   * Benefit from continuous sales of the Power Card, enhancing your investment.
4. **Hardware and Communication**:
   * Receive a CoNET PowerCard, a portable smart hardware miner.
   * Access encrypted private communication tools and a decentralized Wi-Fi router.

**Features of Guardian Super Nodes**

**Referral and Reward Program**

Guardians are incentivized to expand the community by referring new members:

* **Referral Rewards**: Earn a 10% USDT reward for each new Guardian Plan purchased by referred individuals.
* **Booster Rewards**: Increase your earnings with the Booster Reward coefficient, enhancing the CNTP points you receive based on the activity of those you've referred.

**Financial Security and Investments**

* **Smart Contract Assurance**: Execute a repurchase agreement through a smart contract at 100% of the purchase price in USDT assets after one year, securing your initial investment.
* **CNTP Points System**: Earn points every 12 seconds based on your level of contribution to the network, with a Booster Accelerate rate that increases the more you invest.

\
**Repurchase: Your investment is secured**\
You can execute a repurchase agreement through a smart contract at 100% of the purchase price in USDT assets after one-year successful IGO purchase.

\
_**-Repurchase Lock-up Period.**_\
Within one year from the data of purchase of the "Guardian Plan."

_**-Repurchase early access.**_\
If the CoNET token ($CONET) is listed on a major exchange like Coinbase, Binance, OKX, or BitGet during the repurchase lock-up period. Guardians will have a 7-day grace period to determine if they wish to participate in the repurchase program.\
\
\
&#xNAN;_**What if I haven't activated the repurchase?**_\
Failure to activate your repurchase option within the designated window will result in automatic waiver of this right.

_**What happens if I activate the repurchase?**_\
Activating the repurchase option will permanently remove all associated Guardian rights. However, any CoNET tokens ($CONET) you've exchanged for referral points ($CNTP), Blast airdrop tokens, or CoNET portable hardware mining machines will remain yours.

_**What will happen to my tokens and PowerCard?**_\
Super Node Points ($CNTP) converted from CoNET tokens ($CONET) will be destroyed. Super node privileges will revert back to the CoNET project. Portable hardware mining machines remain usable for Proof-of-Stake (POS) mining. However, their hash rate will be adjusted to match that of standard users.\
\
\
**Conclusion**

Being a Guardian is not only about managing a Supernode; it's about being a part of a community dedicated to revolutionizing the Internet. It's a significant commitment with substantial benefits and the potential to reshape how we interact with digital infrastructure. Join us in this revolutionary endeavor to build a truly secure and decentralized Internet.
