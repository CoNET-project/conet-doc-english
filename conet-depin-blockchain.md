# CoNET DePIN Blockchain

## CoNET’s DePIN Architecture: The First Blockchain Natively Built for DePIN

CoNET is revolutionizing decentralized infrastructure with the launch of the CoNET DePIN Blockchain, the first blockchain to integrate DePIN capabilities natively. This innovative blockchain is also loaded on CoNET DePIN, becoming the first blockchain to utilize wallet addresses for communication instead of IP addresses, setting a new standard for privacy and decentralization.



### Key Features of the CoNET DePIN Blockchain&#x20;



**1. Native Token: ETH on CoNET Network**\
CoNET uses ETH as the native token for gas fees, maintaining compatibility with Ethereum while offering cheaper and faster transactions tailored for decentralized infrastructure needs.

**2. Privacy-Centric Design**\
Loaded on CoNET DePIN and powered by the Layer Minus Protocol, IP addresses are replaced by wallet-based validation, ensuring anonymity for users and nodes while enhancing overall network security.

**3. Validator Rewards in ETH**\
Validators secure the network and validate transactions, earning ETH as compensation, providing lucrative and sustainable earning opportunities.

**4. Custom-Built for DePIN**\
CoNET’s blockchain integrates decentralized resource sharing, such as bandwidth, CPU, and storage contributions, into its architecture, making it the first blockchain purpose-built for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks.

**5. Optimized Transactions**\
Gas fees are significantly reduced compared to Ethereum, BEP-20 and many others, making participation more affordable while ensuring high- speed, secure transactions.



### A Network Built for Scalability and Real-World Utility Node Ecosystem



1. **Validator Nodes**\
   Secure the network, validate transactions, and earn ETH rewards.
2. **Full and Partial Nodes**\
   Share resources like bandwidth, CPU, and storage to power decentralized apps like Silent Pass, earning $CONET tokens.&#x20;
3. &#x20;**Browser-Based Mining**\
   \-The high-priced hardware requirements of Bitcoin and the high collateral requirements of Ethereum have contributed to increasing centralization in blockchains.\
   \-CoNET counters this by allowing anyone to contribute to the network using simple browser-based mining tools, promoting a healthier, more decentralized blockchain ecosystem.
4. **Scalable and Efficient Architecture**\
   Built to handle high transaction volumes, the CoNET Blockchain ensures speed, security, and scalability for future growth.
5. **Silent Pass as a DePIN Use Case**\
   Silent Pass, CoNET’s decentralized VPN, showcases how resource sharing and wallet-based validation power real-world applications within the network.

### Why CoNET’s Blockchain Stands Out&#x20;



**1. First Blockchain for DePIN**\
By natively integrating decentralized infrastructure features, CoNET addresses the specific needs of DePIN networks.

**2. Enhanced Privacy**\
Wallet-to-wallet communication ensures user anonymity, making CoNET a leader in privacy-first blockchain solutions.&#x20;

**3. Real-World Applications**\
From VPNs to proxy services and decentralized storage, CoNET’s blockchain powers tools that meet genuine user needs.

**4. Sustainable Rewards**\
Validators and node operators earn ETH and $CONET, ensuring a robust incentive model.&#x20;

**5. Accessible Participation**\
With reduced gas fees, browser-based mining, and easy onboarding, CoNET lowers barriers to entry for all users.

## Building a Decentralized, User-Centric Future

CoNET’s DePIN Blockchain represents a significant step forward in decentralizing the internet. By combining Ethereum’s robust security with CoNET’s privacy-focused enhancements, this blockchain provides a scalable, community-driven platform for real-world applications and sustainable growth.
