# Silent Pass

\
CoNET's Silent Pass stands out from traditional VPNs like ExpressVPN through its unique architecture and privacy-enhancing technologies. Unlike conventional VPNs that route traffic through centralized servers, Silent Pass leverages the decentralized, zero-trust Layer Minus network, offering a higher level of privacy and security. Here’s why it’s different:

\
**Fragmented Data Transmission**: Silent Pass breaks down internet requests into multiple fragments that are processed separately over different nodes in the CONET network. This fragmentation makes it virtually impossible for anyone to reconstruct your browsing data or track your online activities.

**Traffic Obfuscation**: Using CONET’s wallet-to-wallet communication model, Silent Pass ensures that your IP address is never exposed or traceable. This system masks your digital footprint, preventing network monitors from identifying that you’re using a privacy service.

**Decentralized Privacy**: By decentralizing the point of access to the internet across multiple servers and using blockchain-based wallet addresses for routing, Silent Pass ensures that your online presence is anonymous and secure from centralized vulnerabilities.

**Ease of Use and Accessibility**: Using Silent Pass requires CNTP tokens, which users can obtain through free mining. This accessibility makes Silent Pass not only a tool for privacy but also an introduction to decentralized applications on the Layer Minus Protocol.

\
Together, these features make Silent Pass a robust solution for those seeking genuine privacy and a revolutionary approach to internet access, setting it apart from traditional VPN solutions. Stay tuned for more dApps built on the innovative Layer Minus Protocol, designed for easy setup and free usage.
