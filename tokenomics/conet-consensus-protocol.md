# CONET Consensus Protocol

CONET adopts three different consensus mechanisms in its three distinct development stages:

1.  **Initiation Stage: Proof-of-Time Consensus**

    Participants register, act as relay nodes, and connect to the CONET network to prove the online time of their devices. Every 10 seconds, the total number of online participants is calculated, and rewards are allocated based on the total weight. Relay nodes require devices with unique IP addresses, and a single IP address cannot run two nodes.
2.  **Development Period: Coexistence of Proof-of-Time and PoW Consensus**

    In addition to the Proof-of-Time relay nodes, users can register SaaS nodes for mining computational power. SaaS nodes gain corresponding rewards by providing computational power. Multiple SaaS nodes can operate on the same IP address. Miners can earn additional rewards through the actual usage of network bandwidth and SaaS computational power, forwarded by dAPPs, in addition to the rewards allocated by the CONET reward pool.
3.  **Stability Period: Decaying Rewards from the CONET Pool**

    Rewards allocated from actual applications through dAPPs take precedence. A fair trade free market is established between miners and users. Miners can bid for their equipment, and users have the right to choose participants with high cost-effectiveness as network service providers.

This consensus model evolves with CONET's development, transitioning from the initial Proof-of-Time consensus to the combination with PoW, and finally to a stable period characterized by free-market competition. This progression reflects the project's adaptation and evolution at different stages.
