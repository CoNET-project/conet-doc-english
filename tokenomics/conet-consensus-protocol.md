# CONET Consensus Protocol

#### **CoNET Consensus Protocol**

CoNET employs a **hybrid consensus mechanism** that evolves over its development stages, combining **Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Staking (PoS), and Proof of upTime (PoT)** to ensure **scalability, security, and decentralization**.

***

#### **Initiation Stage: Proof-of-Time (PoT) Consensus**

In its early phase, CoNET focuses on ensuring **network participation and reliability** through **Proof of upTime (PoT)**.\
ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

* Participants register as **relay nodes** and connect to the CoNET network, proving their devices remain online.
* Every **10 seconds**, the network calculates the total number of online nodes, allocating rewards based on uptime weight.
* Relay nodes require devices with **unique wallet addresses** (no duplicate nodes per device).\
  ðŸ”¹ **Purpose:**
* Encourages widespread participation to strengthen the network.
* Ensures active and stable nodes to build a **robust decentralized infrastructure**.

#### **Development Period: Hybrid Model (PoT + PoW)**

As CoNET grows, **Proof of Work (PoW)** is introduced alongside PoT to **incentivize computational contributions** and expand network capabilities.\
ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

* **Relay Nodes (PoT):** Continue earning rewards based on uptime.
* **SaaS Nodes (PoW):** Users register nodes that provide computational power, bandwidth, and storage.
* Multiple SaaS nodes can **operate on the same wallet**, allowing flexibility in contribution.
* Miners earn rewards not only from the CoNET pool but also from **real usage** by dApps and network participants.\
  ðŸ”¹ **Purpose:**
* Encourages computational power sharing for **decentralized applications (dApps)**.
* Bridges the transition from uptime-based participation to **resource-sharing incentives**.

#### **Stability Period: PoS, PoT & PoW Integration**

In the mature stage, CoNET operates on a fully integrated **PoS + PoT + PoW** model, ensuring **sustainability, efficiency, and decentralized governance**.\
ðŸ”¹ **How It Works:**

* **Proof of Staking (PoS):** Users stake **$CONET or $ETH** to operate **Validator, Full, or Partial Nodes**, ensuring **economic security & long-term commitment**.
* **Proof of upTime (PoT):** Nodes that maintain high uptime **earn additional incentives**, rewarding stability and participation.
* **Proof of Work (PoW):** Beyond transaction validation, PoW ensures:
  * Nodes stay **online and connected** to maintain network resilience.
  * **Verification of social tasks** and decentralized applications.
  * **Computational power for dApps**, supporting a **privacy-first, decentralized infrastructure**.

ðŸ”¹ **Market-Driven Rewards:**

* As CoNET matures, rewards prioritize **real network usage** over our pool allocations.
* A **fair-trade model** is established, where miners bid for their services and users select the most cost-effective providers.
