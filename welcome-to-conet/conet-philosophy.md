# CONET Philosophy

> Privacy is necessary for an open society - _**"The Crypto Punk Manifesto"**_

The history of humanity is a history of decentralization, from monarchy to republic, from planned economy to market economy—all indicative of a decentralized history. The Leviathan, written by the political philosophy progenitor Thomas Hobbes, advocates for monarchy. Subjects pledge allegiance to the monarch, who is responsible for maintaining order. However, people soon realized that a monarch was unnecessary; it was merely an intermediary. The exorbitant cost of sustaining a prodigal monarch intermediary was too high, and a republic could also maintain order. The social contract theory, akin to smart contracts, prevents rulers from acting arbitrarily.

Alexis de Tocqueville's "Democracy in America" aptly describes the United States as a blockchain nation. In American towns, there are no visible government officials; it operates on community autonomy, resembling a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

Throughout human history, each societal upgrade has been guided by a new worldview. Ancient ancestors initiated a hunting civilization; the Ptolemaic geocentric theory marked the beginning of an agricultural civilization; Copernicus' heliocentric theory initiated a commercial civilization; Newton's absolute space-time theory marked the Industrial Age; Einstein's theory of relativity marked the nuclear electronic age. Newton's "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" explored the forces of nature through material motion phenomena, explaining natural phenomena with these forces and laying the foundation for industrial society. Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" outlines future societal landscapes.

In the 20th century, humanity proved that matter equals energy, following the law of entropy increase. In the 21st century, it demonstrated that matter equals information, and information also follows the law of entropy increase. Consequently, the universe, from information density to decompression, evolved to enable humans to contemplate the universe's entirety. Seventy years ago, the invention of computers entered the bit era; fifty years ago, the invention of the internet entered the era of shared information; fifteen years ago, the invention of blockchain entered the era of mutual trust in value.

The emergence of blockchain leads us in a new direction. This consensus system utilizes technology to generate passive trust and establishes an immutable consensus mechanism. So far, this passive trust is the highest boundary of trust—one that fundamentally requires no trust. It is a technological revolution capable of directly solving modern human civilization bottlenecks. Blockchain can do more than bring about financial changes. Cryptocurrency is just one embodiment of value transfer. It represents the transfer of energy in the process of things, an essential element of life activities. It can bring us more—from finance to business, entertainment to culture, property to law, privacy to freedom, consciousness to cognition, and even from the democratic era to the post-democratic era. Essentially, the social fissure formed by blockchain will rewrite the future development of human civilization, once again propelling the entire human civilization into a period of rapid development. This is the only path for humanity to explore the future.

For global finance, the internet has accelerated the digitization of financial assets. However, in this process, we have been enslaved due to the opacity and restrictions of internet technology. Asset security and the crisis of trust have become the greatest threats to personal asset security. The emergence of blockchain technology has given many people a glimpse of a hopeful future. With this new technology, people are beginning to realize that most social conflicts are caused by centralization. Perhaps decentralization is the only therapeutic method. Blockchain perfectly addresses this global crisis of trust, and cryptocurrency has found a way out for the security of our assets.

CONET is not just a single project but an integration of various research results based on a decentralized private blockchain network. It will play a significant role in identity security, internet freedom, private social interaction, decentralized finance, and business. It can be said that what CONET is doing is rebuilding a completely new, open internet on decentralized anonymous nodes. This will usher us into an unprecedented space of freedom on the internet.
