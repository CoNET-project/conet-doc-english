# Introduction

CONET is the underlying infrastructure that realizes the vision of Web3. It establishes a physical-virtual network infrastructure on the internet using the Layer Minus communication protocol.

Once users enter the CONET network, their encrypted wallet addresses replace internet IP addresses, serving as device identifiers for anonymous, secure, and private data communication.

CONET can serve as the underlying network infrastructure for various types of data communication, including regular internet data communication, blockchain communication, and IoT (Internet of Things). It brings privacy, anonymity, and security to these forms of data communication.

**From Bitcoin to CONET:**&#x20;

In the electronic age, privacy is indispensable for an open society. Privacy, as distinguished from secrecy, is something one doesn't want the world to know, and it is a form of power, allowing individuals to decide what to disclose or keep private (source: "Cypherpunk Manifesto").

**The Cypherpunk Movement**

The Cypherpunk movement heavily influenced the ideology and technology behind Bitcoin (BTC). Satoshi Nakamoto's creation of Bitcoin in 2008 integrated the thoughts and technologies emerging from the Cypherpunk movement. BTC creatively merged asymmetric encryption and timestamp server technology, establishing incentives through proof-of-work using hash cash principles.

BTC's origins lie in the core concepts of Cypherpunk ideology—defending individual online privacy. The Cypherpunk movement foresaw the challenges of trusting large central entities with personal privacy in the internet era.

**CONET Inherits the Spirit of Cypherpunk:**

CONET inherits the spirit of Cypherpunk, which emphasizes the protection of individual online privacy and mistrust of large central entities. The key technologies required by CONET, including asymmetric encryption, timestamp servers, hash cash, and distributed ledgers, can be traced back to Cypherpunk principles.

The introduction of HTTP ushered in the prosperous internet era. However, behind this prosperity lies the accurate predictions of early Cypherpunks—ubiquitous collection of personal data, the centralized monopoly of internet giants, and surveillance by central entities. This has exposed billions of people to massive surveillance and data breaches.

CONET recognizes the strong demand for privacy protection from individuals and enterprises worldwide. It believes that billions of people and billions of connected devices need privacy protection. The entire blockchain ecosystem also requires privacy protection to avoid risks such as asset insecurity, traceability of operations, auditability, and scalability issues in business applications.

Inspired by these challenges, CONET proposes new foundational standards and open-source privacy protocols based on WEB3, returning data ownership and privacy to individuals. CONET's programmability and scalability make large-scale commercial use possible, enabling previously unimaginable applications and markets.

CONET builds upon the experiences gained from 15 years of Bitcoin experimentation and the advancements in cryptographic research. It stands on the shoulders of giants such as Merkle, Rivest, Hellman, Finney, Wuille, Boneh, applying new cryptography, some of which CONET has helped invent and refine, to embark on the next chapter in the journey initiated by Bitcoin.
