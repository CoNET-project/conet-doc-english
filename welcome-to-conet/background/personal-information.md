# PERSONAL INFORMATION

Technological advancements have brought forth tools for collecting and interpreting various types of information, making possible what was once considered impossible or difficult to achieve. For instance, the role of DNA in genetics was confirmed in the 1950s. Today, advancements in genetic science enable scientists to extract DNA from smaller samples and determine more characteristics based on an individual's DNA. Digital storage of DNA plays a significant role in solving crimes, helping to apprehend the true culprits in many unsolved cases and exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals.

However, retaining DNA also poses significant privacy risks as it contains sensitive personal information, such as susceptibility to certain diseases. In the field of biometrics, there have been notable advances, including facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, and iris scanning, which are increasingly popular methods for security authentication. These biometric methods serve various purposes, from preventing fraud by retailers and restaurant owners to verifying voters in elections, facilitating immigration without passports, recording work attendance, and entering high-security areas.

While these applications offer significant societal benefits, concerns about the control of digital data, particularly regarding storage and usage, have emerged. Controversies have arisen, such as the use of full-body imaging procedures in airport security following attempts by terrorists to smuggle bombs on planes. Passengers dislike the intrusion of technology penetrating their clothing and revealing a naked image to others, considering it a violation of their privacy. These images can disclose personal information, such as whether someone has undergone cosmetic surgery or uses a colostomy bag, and many people believe that clothing is part of their bodily privacy.

Certainly, a balance must be struck between passenger safety and privacy concerns. However, achieving the right balance in this rapidly changing era is extremely challenging.
