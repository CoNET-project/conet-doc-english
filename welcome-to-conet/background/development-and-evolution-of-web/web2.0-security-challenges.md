# Web2.0 security challenges

Today's web2.0 applications are open-access and dynamically generated, making this feature more interesting but also bringing about greater security risks.

For example, users/hackers may upload content that can run code or carry malicious software to perform malicious tasks. Sometimes hackers may upload software like free antivirus software to social networking sites like Facebook (now people are overly addicted to Facebook or other social networking sites, users blindly click on every link, and every application, and hackers exploit this foolish behavior) or any other site that should be virus removal software but loads Trojan horses. Hackers may upload harmful code, which may include keyloggers that capture the victim's keystrokes, including credit card information and passwords, and send them back to the hacker.

**Common Web2.0 Vulnerabilities:**

1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
3. SQL Injection
4. Authentication and Authorization Flaws
5. Information Leakage

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In an XSS attack, the hacker injects their executable code into legitimate, dynamically generated web pages. Whenever someone visits or downloads that specific page, the code residing on the page executes on the victim's computer, providing a pathway for the hacker to control the victim's computer.

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** In a CSRF attack, the hacker uses the victim's IP address or cookie to gain access or bypass firewall protection for visiting sites the victim has visited, such as e-commerce, corporate intranets, or other websites/authentications. This allows the hacker to act as the computer owner and perform malicious actions, like extracting funds from personal bank accounts, purchasing items from e-commerce websites, stealing data from corporate intranets, or changing the configuration of routers or local firewalls.

**SQL Injection:** In SQL injection, the hacker injects their own SQL queries by inserting application input data or "injecting" their SQL query. Attackers can access not only the client's web application but also the database, depending on whether the attacker can access the operating system's database. In Xpath injection, attackers modify XML queries to achieve their goals. In JSON injection, attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the client website's JSON. When the client logs into the target website (the site the attacker wants to infiltrate) with a validated user identity, the attacker sends a link to the victim and convinces her to visit the infected site (created by the hacker). If the client visits the infected site while already logged into the target site, all information existing in the target site is sent to the hacker.

**XSS Worms:** Hackers inject self-propagating XSS code into web pages/applications, which spread when users visit the page.

**Mashups:** The primary idea behind mashups is to combine all resources or services from multiple websites into a single user experience. It can dynamically connect to websites that are not necessarily under the provider's control, posing a security risk to content providers.

**Authentication and Authorization Flaws:** Authentication and authorization technologies have various weaknesses, such as passwords without a maximum age limit, fixed password length and complexity, passwords that can be guessed (lack of brute force protection), predictable session IDs, no time limits or life cycles on session IDs, and using only one ID for the entire session.

**Information Leakage:** Sometimes applications unintentionally leak information about their internal workings and configurations, such as adding some small modifications to the URL, allowing us to obtain multiple pieces of information each time. For example, "[http://www.mywebsites.com/home.html](http://www.mywebsites.com/home.html)" instead of "home.html," and if we try "admin.html" (which should not exist in the website interface), sometimes it may display that specific page (if it exists on the server).
