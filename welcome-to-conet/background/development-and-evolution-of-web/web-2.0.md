# WEB 2.0

Web2.0 is referred to as the read-write web. It is essentially a new approach using existing internet technologies. In Web2.0, web users can not only read content but also write, edit, and update content online. It supports collaboration and contributes to collective intelligence, unlike Web1.0. Web2.0, with the evolution of the next generation of web services, shifts the internet onto a platform supporting a new thought process and sharing content through applications like wikis, weblogs, widgets, and mashups.

5. Network Effects: Relates to the increased usefulness of a system when more users join.
