# WEB 1.0

It is the origin of the Web. On August 7, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee posted an introduction to the World Wide Web project on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, marking the birth of public services on the global information network. That day can be considered the first year of the Web; under the proliferation of technological products and the development of the Internet, humanity globally could establish a virtual space, a virtual world, beyond the constraints of time and space on this "web," changing many business models, generating new cultures, and identities. People could simultaneously live in two or even more worlds.

Web1.0 is characterized as a read-only network, where a small number of producers create web pages (interconnected), and a large number of users access these pages through browsers. Users can only read information; they cannot interact with the content of the pages, such as comments or answers. The technologies used in Web1.0 include HTML, HTTP, and URI as core network protocols, along with newer protocols like XML, XHTML, and CSS. In Web1.0, both server-side and client-side use server-side scripts such as ASP, PHP, JSP, CGI, PERL, and client-side scripts such as JavaScript, VBScript, and Flash.

**Disadvantages of Web1.0**

Include its slow and cumbersome nature; every time new information is input into a web page, a full refresh is required. Web1.0 does not support bidirectional communication; it is purely based on the client-pull model (HTTP), initiated only by the client. The search technology used in Web1.0 is considered hopeless; it primarily focuses on the size of the index, ignoring relevance and self-discovery. The most significant mistake behind Web1.0 is ignoring the power of the network effect; with few authors and many readers, the network becomes slow, and user resources are scarce. The more people use a network service, the more useful it becomes for everyone using that network. However, Web1.0, by allowing only reading and neglecting this concept, misunderstood the dynamics of the Web, treating software as applications rather than services. Web1.0 relies on old software business models.
