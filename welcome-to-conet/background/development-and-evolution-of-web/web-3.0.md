# WEB 3.0

"What is Web3.0?" This question is challenging to answer, as different internet experts have various perspectives and opinions on the future of the internet. Major IT experts view Web3.0 as a semantic web and personalized experience. According to Conrad Wolfram, Web3.0 is where computers generate and process new information, surpassing human capabilities. Google CEO Eric Schmidt states that Web3.0 will be "a collection of applicationsâ€”relatively small in size, data in the cloud, can run on any device (PC or mobile), fast, highly customizable, and virally distributed (social networks, email, etc.)"

**Definition of Web3.0:** Web3.0 is an internet controlled by individuals. It represents a new level of network development based on the current internet (Web 2.0). Web3.0 aims to cover the current internet giants' monopoly, protect the interests of every internet user, establish a unified identity authentication system, ensure data rights and authorization, achieve decentralized operation, privacy protection, and resistance to censorship.

**Key Elements of Web3.0:** Web3.0 builds on various popular applications and services from recent years. Search engines can generate more comprehensive and targeted information, users can connect more closely through social media applications, and more robust information recording and storage capabilities make Web3.0 more precise and beneficial for internet users. In this section, we will introduce some key elements that could become the building blocks of the next generation internet.

1. **Social Networks:** Over the past few decades, social networks have gained popularity among like-minded individuals and community groups. They use Web3.0 technology to share their feelings, thoughts, and ideas, going beyond simply linking documents. Social networks are considered an effective and attractive way to connect people globally.
2. **Semantic Web:** The semantic web is an evolving extension of Web3.0 that allows people to search for information more deeply, understanding the meaning of words and using them in context. Information is structured in a way that AI machines can read and comprehend it like humans without ambiguity.
3. **New Protocols:** Web3.0 will reconstruct new protocol standards. If the underlying protocol is still based on HTTP, it's not truly Web3.0 but an extension of Web2.0. Web3.0 will create new internet paradigms and interaction methods.

**Security and Challenges of Web3.0:** As we transition from Web1.0 to Web3.0, various issues related to scalability, security, and performance present challenges for IT experts. The massive collaboration of public and private data makes Web2.0 and Web3.0 more interactive and popular among internet users and hackers.

1. **Lack of Data Standards for Controlling Metadata and Data Privacy:** The absence of data standards for controlling metadata and data privacy is a vulnerability. RDF schemas (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to represent data access policies or trust boundaries that can be stored in databases and/or exchanged without specifying any content. This makes Web3.0 susceptible to attacks, as attackers may deliberately forge data and create false services.
2. **Data Privacy in Web3.0:** Data privacy is one of the most concerning security issues for users in Web3.0. Producers and customers create new content and technologies daily, sharing them with anyone worldwide. If someone lets you have complete control over their private data (such as in online games) under the assumption that you are a trustworthy person who can manage their data well, what happens when that trust is betrayed? Complete control over someone's data allows for potential errors or intentional modifications that can be disseminated worldwide. Illegitimate and manipulated forms of the same type of data will proliferate on the internet, potentially causing errors for anyone.

Web3.0 is a new internet infrastructure where users and builders independently own and trust. CoNET will create new standards based on WEB3, an open-source privacy protocol, representing a paradigm shift. It truly restores data ownership and privacy to individuals. CoNET's programmability and scalability make large-scale commercialization possible, enabling applications and markets previously unimaginable.
