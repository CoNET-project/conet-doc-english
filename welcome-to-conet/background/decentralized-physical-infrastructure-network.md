# Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network

DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks) refers to a network that connects the digital space and physical space in a decentralized manner through encryption technology. It must adhere to the following two principles:

Dependence on decentralized networks and communities rather than centralized companies for transactions and business logic.

Virtual assets can be used to purchase tangible assets in the real world, such as electricity, telecommunication services, network data transmission, and data access.

In summary, the creation of DePIN is aimed at providing real-world value.

Why DePIN is Needed: DePIN addresses several issues when compared to traditional centralized ICT infrastructure:

Monopoly Pricing Power: DePIN eliminates the monopoly pricing power that centralized entities may have over infrastructure services.

Inefficient Infrastructure Resource Utilization: DePIN improves the efficiency of infrastructure resource utilization by leveraging a decentralized model.

KYC (Know Your Customer) Identity Verification Mechanism: DePIN provides an alternative to traditional KYC mechanisms, ensuring identity verification in a decentralized manner.

Categories of DePIN Projects: DePIN projects can be categorized based on the different components constituting DePIN, including hardware, resources, goods, and services. These projects fall into two main categories:

Decentralized Hardware and Resources: Projects focusing on the decentralized provision of hardware and resources, ensuring accessibility and availability.

Virtual Assets for Real-world Purchases: Projects enabling the use of virtual assets for the acquisition of tangible assets in the physical world, such as utilities and data services.

**DePINâ€™s Token Economic Model**

DePIN's core logic is to incentivize users to contribute resources, including GPU computing power, deployed hotspots, storage space, and more, through token rewards, connecting the digital and physical spaces in a decentralized manner.

In the early stages of DePIN projects, tokens often lack actual value. User participation in providing network resources is somewhat similar to venture capitalists. The supply side selects promising projects among various DePIN projects, invests resources to become "risk miners," and profits through increased token quantity and potential token price appreciation.

Providers in DePIN differ from traditional miners as they may provide resources related to hardware, bandwidth, computing power, etc. Their token income is often based on network usage, market demand, and other relevant factors. If network usage is low, resulting in reduced rewards, or if the network is attacked or unstable, it leads to wasted resources. Therefore, DePIN risk miners need to be willing to bear potential risks and provide resources for the stable development of the network, playing a crucial role in the process.

This incentive mechanism forms a flywheel effect, creating a positive cycle during favorable development and a potential negative cycle during downturns.

Attracting participants on the supply side through tokens: By employing a well-designed token economics model, early participants are attracted to contribute to network construction and resource provision, receiving token rewards in return.

Attracting builders and network consumers: With the increase in resource providers, some developers join the ecosystem to construct products. Simultaneously, consumers are attracted due to DePIN offering lower prices compared to decentralized infrastructure, leading to increased participation on the supply side.

Forming positive feedback: As the number of consumer users grows, the incentive for the supply side participants increases, creating positive feedback. This attracts more participants on both sides.

In this cycle, the supply side receives more valuable token rewards, while the demand side gets services with higher cost-effectiveness. The project's token value and the growth of participants on both sides remain consistent. With the rise in token prices, more participants and speculators are attracted, resulting in value capture.
