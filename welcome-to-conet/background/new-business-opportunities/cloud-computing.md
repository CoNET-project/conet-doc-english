# CLOUD COMPUTING

Unlike personal computers, cloud computing processes or software are stored on remote servers and accessed through the internet. Cloud computing comes in various forms and can provide a range of different services, allowing individuals or organizations to effectively borrow computing power from remote service providers. For instance, Google's applications enable people to create and save spreadsheets and word documents online. Other services include collaboration platforms, allowing users to simultaneously access multiple documents, such as collaboration between different applications in the Google Workspace.

Cloud computing can bring about many benefits. For example, for small businesses and organizations, cloud computing can reduce the costs of purchasing and updating software, especially benefiting users in developing countries with limited financial resources. By allowing users to access documents from around the world or collaborate on document writing with people in different locations, cloud computing provides more convenience for users.

However, cloud computing also raises many concerns about privacy. Because data is stored on third-party software, the responsibility for protecting this data falls on the third party providing the service, and users lose control over the data to some extent. Additionally, legal protection for cloud computing is not yet comprehensive enough to guarantee the privacy of user data. Terms and conditions (T\&Cs) sometimes state that service providers have the right to terminate accounts or modify/edit content at their discretion. Many terms and conditions strictly limit the liability of service providers, meaning that if there is a security breach resulting in the loss of user personal data, users may not receive any compensation.

Ultimately, once a service provider closes or deletes an account, they often do not provide any explanation to users. However, closing or deleting an account does not necessarily mean that user information is also removed, so there is still a possibility of privacy breaches after an account is deactivated.
