## CoNET Nodes: Get Involved and Earn with Our DePIN Network

As CoNET prepares to launch our decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) on the Arbitrum Orbit, we're offering a unique opportunity for users to participate and earn rewards by operating nodes that power our ecosystem. By becoming a part of our node infrastructure, you can help secure our network, contribute resources, and earn daily rewards in return. CoNET will feature three types of nodes, each with specific roles, requirements, and earning potential.

***

### 1. Validator Nodes: Earn ETH by Validating Transactions

**Role:**\
Validator Nodes are responsible for verifying transactions on the CoNET DePIN network. As validators, these nodes are crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of the decentralized infrastructure.

**Earnings:**\
Validator Nodes earn rewards in ETH, as CoNET is built on the Arbitrum Orbit blockchain. This provides a daily income stream for validator operators, paid through transaction fees on the network.

**Node Cap:**\
Validator Nodes are limited to 20,000, ensuring that early adopters gain privileged positions within the CoNET ecosystem. To reward our early investors, this number will remain fixed for at least five years.

**Requirements:**

* **Guardian Plan Holders:** Purchasers of the Guardian Plan have an exclusive right to become Validator Nodes without the need for staking.
* **Staking Requirement:** For others wishing to become validators, a stake of 20,000 $CONET tokens is required.

### 2. Full Nodes: Critical Network Support for Silent Pass and More

**Role:**\
Full Nodes serve as the backbone of the CoNET network, handling Proof of Time and Proof of Work verifications. They also play a vital role in running services like Silent Pass, CoNET’s decentralized VPN, by sharing their IP address, bandwidth, and CPU resources. Full Nodes can optionally contribute storage to further support the network.

**Earnings:**\
Full Nodes earn higher rewards due to their critical role in maintaining network operations and providing key services like Silent Pass.

**Responsibilities:**

* Validate Proof of Time and Proof of Work.
* Act as servers for Silent Pass and other CoNET services.
* Share IP addresses, bandwidth, CPU, and optionally, storage.

**Requirements:**

* **Staking Required:** Full Nodes must stake a certain amount of $CONET tokens to participate.

### 3. Partial Nodes: Supporting the Network through Resource Sharing

**Role:**\
Partial Nodes contribute to the network by sharing CPU and bandwidth without needing to share their IP address. They also have the option to share storage. While they may not play as central a role as Full Nodes, they are essential for validating social tasks and contributing to the overall DePIN network.

**Earnings:**\
Partial Nodes earn rewards for their contributions, which include validating social tasks and performing SaaS (Software as a Service) validations.

**Responsibilities:**

* Validate social tasks such as verifying the completion of social tasks across various platforms using CoNET's decentralized API.
* Participate in SaaS activities like validating software services within the network.
* Optionally share storage for additional rewards.

**Requirements:**

* **Staking:** Partial Nodes require a smaller amount of $CONET tokens staked compared to Full Nodes, making them accessible to a wider range of participants.

#### Contributing to CoNET's DePIN Network

By operating any of these nodes, you become an integral part of CoNET's decentralized physical infrastructure network, contributing to a shared economy where participants provide valuable resources in exchange for rewards. Whether you're validating transactions as a Validator Node, running services like Silent Pass as a Full Node, or validating social tasks as a Partial Node, you're helping to build a decentralized internet focused on privacy, security, and user empowerment.

### Why Become a CoNET Node Operator?

* **Daily Earnings:** Validator Nodes earn ETH, while Full and Partial Nodes earn $CONET tokens.
* **Long-Term Benefits:** Validator Nodes are limited in number, offering exclusive earning potential over the next five years.
* **Support Decentralization:** Help power a decentralized infrastructure that prioritizes privacy and security for users worldwide.
