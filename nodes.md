## CoNET Nodes: Get Involved and Earn with Our DePIN Network

As CoNET prepares to launch our decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) on the Arbitrum Orbit, we're offering a unique opportunity for users to participate and earn rewards by operating nodes that power our ecosystem. By becoming a part of our node infrastructure, you can help secure our network, contribute resources, and earn daily rewards in return. CoNET will feature three types of nodes, each with specific roles, requirements, and earning potential.

***

### 1. Validator Nodes: Earn ETH by Validating Transactions

**Role:**\
Validator Nodes are responsible for verifying transactions on the CoNET DePIN network. As validators, these nodes are crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of the decentralized infrastructure.

**Earnings:**\
Validator Nodes earn rewards in ETH, as CoNET is built on the Arbitrum Orbit blockchain. This provides a daily income stream for validator operators, paid through transaction fees on the network.

**Node Cap:**\
Validator Nodes are limited to 20,000, ensuring that early adopters gain privileged positions within the CoNET ecosystem.&#x20;

To reward Guardians , our early investors, this number will remain fixed for at least five years.

**Requirements:**

* **Guardian Plan Holders:** Purchasers of the Guardian Plan have an exclusive right to become Validator Nodes without the need for staking.
* **Staking Requirement:** For others wishing to become validators, a stake of 20,000 $CONET tokens is required.

### 2. Full Nodes: Critical Network Support for Silent Pass and More

**Role:**\
Full Nodes serve as the backbone of the CoNET network, handling Proof of Time and Proof of Work verifications. They also play a vital role in running services like Silent Pass, CoNET’s decentralized VPN, by sharing their IP address, bandwidth, and CPU resources. Full Nodes can optionally contribute storage to further support the network.

**Earnings:**\
Full Nodes earn higher rewards due to their critical role in maintaining network operations and providing key services like Silent Pass.

**Responsibilities:**

* Validate Proof of Time and Proof of Work.
* Act as servers for Silent Pass and other CoNET services.
* Share IP addresses, bandwidth, CPU, and optionally, storage.

**Requirements:**

* **Staking Required:** Full Nodes must stake a certain amount of $CONET ( 10.000 )tokens to participate.
* **Mandatory Cloud Node**: Full nodes require a cloud node service subscription at $5 per month to ensure consistent internet quality and performance 24/7 without need of being online(.

**Minimum System Requirements for Partial and Full Nodes:**

* **2 Core CPU**
* **2 GB RAM**
* **10 GB Storage**

### 3. Partial Nodes: Supporting the Network through Resource Sharing

**Role:**\
Partial Nodes contribute to the network by sharing CPU and bandwidth without needing to share their IP address. They also have the option to share storage. While they may not play as central a role as Full Nodes, they are essential for validating social tasks and contributing to the overall DePIN network.

**Earnings:**\
Partial Nodes earn rewards for their contributions, which include validating social tasks and performing SaaS (Software as a Service) validations.

**Earning**: Rewards are earned for each epoch while connected to mining ( 12 seconds )

**Responsibilities:**

* Validate social tasks such as verifying the completion of social tasks across various platforms using CoNET's decentralized API.
* Participate in SaaS activities like validating software services within the network.
* Optionally share storage for additional rewards.

**Requirements:**

* **Staking:** Partial Nodes require a smaller amount of $CONET ( 5.000 ) tokens staked compared to Full Nodes, making them accessible to a wider range of participants.
* **Cloud Node Option**: Partial nodes may choose to purchase a cloud node service for $5 per month to enhance connectivity and stability and for mining 24/7 without need of being online(optional).

**Minimum System Requirements for Partial and Full Nodes:**

* **2 Core CPU**
* **2 GB RAM**
* **10 GB Storage**

***

### 4. Browser Mining: Accessible Participation through Browser-Based Mining

**Role:**\
Browser Mining allows users to participate without specialized hardware, using only a web browser. This option is available for users mining through CoNET’s minigame (on browser or Telegram) or on third-party applications that support CoNET mining like FX168 app or website where users are mining while using this platform.

**Earnings:**\
Browser Miners earn $CONET rewards based on their mining activity, making it an accessible entry point for new users.

**Requirements:**\
No staking or device requirements; simply use a supported browser to start mining.
