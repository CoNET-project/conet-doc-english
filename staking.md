# Staking

#### Staking with CoNET

CoNET offers multiple staking options, allowing users to earn rewards while supporting the network's security and growth. From running nodes to participating in delegated staking pools, CoNET provides flexible, decentralized, and non-custodial staking solutions. Here's how it works:

***

## 1. Node Staking

Power the Network, Earn Rewards\
CoNET’s Node Staking allows users to contribute to network security and efficiency by staking tokens to run Full or Partial Nodes. This supports decentralized infrastructure and rewards participants for their contributions.

***

### **Full Nodes: Powering the DePIN Network**

Earnings

* Earn $CONET daily with an annual ROI of 43.2%.

Requirements

* Staking: 5,000 $CONET ($500 at presale price), locked for 1 year.
* Price Fixed in USD: The staking amount remains $500 in value following the presale price, adjusting for token price fluctuations.

***

### **Partial Nodes: Flexible Resource Sharing**

Earnings

* Earn $CONET with an annual ROI of 28.8%.

Requirements

* Staking: 1,000 $CONET ($100 at presale price), locked for 180 days.
* Price Fixed in USD: The staking amount remains $100 in value following the presale price, adjusting for token price fluctuations.

## 2. Delegated Staking on SCONET

Earn Rewards Without Running a Node!\
Delegated staking on SCONET allows users to earn passive rewards by staking their tokens without the need to operate a node. Users participate in the Miner Reward Delegating Pool, contributing to network security while enjoying flexible staking options and competitive returns.

\


**Key Features:**

* No Minimum Staking Amount – Stake as much or as little as you want.
* Flexible Staking Periods – Choose from multiple durations with varying reward rates.
* Passive Earning – No technical setup required, just stake and earn.
* Unstaking Period – A one-month unstaking period applies when withdrawing staked tokens.

**Staking Options & Rewards:**

| Staking Period | Annual APR |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| 1 Month        | 6%         |
| 3 Months       | 9%         |
| 6 Months       | 12%        |
| 1 Year         | 18%        |
| 5 Years        | 36%        |

### Decentralized & Non-Custodial Staking Mechanism

Maximum Security, Full Ownership\
Unlike traditional staking models, SCONET's Delegated Staking is fully decentralized and non-custodial. CoNET does not hold or control staked tokens, ensuring complete transparency and security through a burn-and-mint mechanism.

**How It Works:**

* No Locked Funds – Users retain full control of their assets at all times.
* Burn & Mint Process:
*
  * When a user stakes SCONET, the staked amount is temporarily burned, and they receive a staking receipt token representing their stake.
  * When they choose to unstake, the receipt token is burned, and the original SCONET tokens are minted back in equal value.
* True Decentralization – No third party holds the funds; the staking contract ensures full transparency and autonomy.

This mechanism provides maximum security and decentralization, allowing users to earn staking rewards while maintaining full ownership of their assets.

## 3. ETH Staking & Validator Rewards

Earn Rewards by Supporting Network Validation\
CoNET allows users to stake ETH and earn rewards by supporting network validation without the need to run their own hardware. Participants can delegate ETH to Validator Nodes, earning a share of transaction fees while contributing to network security.

* No Minimum Staking Amount – Stake as much or as little as you want.
* No Unstaking Periods – Can stake for one day as Validator rewards are sent daily.

**How It Works:**

* Guardian NFT Holders – Automatically receive 1 Validator Node per NFT.
* ETH Stakers – Can acquire Validator Node shares based on their staked amount:
*
  * 3.2 ETH = 1 Full Validator Node Share
  * 6.4 ETH = 2 Validator Node Shares
  * 0.4 ETH = 1/8 Validator Node Share

### **Validator Reward Pool:**

* All ETH staked is pooled together to create a Validator Reward Pool.
* Rewards are distributed based on the share of each participant’s stake relative to the total pool.
* This system ensures fair distribution while allowing users to participate without technical expertise.
