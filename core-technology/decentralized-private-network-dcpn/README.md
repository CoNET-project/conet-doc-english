# Decentralized Private Network DCPN

As blockchain increasingly relies on centralized cloud infrastructure services, instances of data loss due to centralized cloud service failures have become prevalent. The intensified censorship mechanisms of centralized clouds further deviate blockchain projects from the principles of decentralization.

CONET addresses these challenges through the Layer Minus protocol, constructing a Decentralized CONET Private Network (DCPN). DCPN transforms centralized servers into decentralized servers where everyone becomes a server. It serves both as a participant in shared networks, contributing to bandwidth mining, and as a provider of decentralized network transmission functionality.

Due to the absence of centralized servers, user data is never recorded, leaked, or susceptible to hacking during DCPN transmissions. Individuals and companies from around the world contribute in a distributed manner to build CONET's new internet infrastructure. In return, these contributors receive CONET's cryptographic incentives, fostering more efficient, decentralized, and peaceful infrastructure deployment.

The CONET project progresses through various stages, aiming to establish a low-barrier, permissionless, trustless, fair, and free-market system. This system allows suppliers the freedom to set prices and consumers the freedom to choose. The goal is to achieve a flexible, robust, secure, and reliable open network infrastructure that is immune to single points of failure.
