# Internet Privacy Communication Solutions

The majority of existing privacy-enhancing tools are based on the substitution of the sender's IP address with that of the service provider to conceal the true sender's IP address metadata.

[**Virtual Private Network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual\_private\_network) **(VPN):**

* _Advantages:_ Seamless integration with all internet applications. By hiding the true destination IP address, it allows the sender to evade monitoring of communication partners and applications. Internet service providers, as they receive the IP address of the VPN provider, can hide the sender's real location. VPNs can only provide sender anonymity, not anonymity for the internet service provider.
* _Disadvantages:_ User anonymity cannot be maintained through payment, as the VPN provider can record network access traces. VPN-specific communication protocols can be intercepted by network monitoring (e.g., [China's firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Firewall) blocking VPN communication protocols).

**Tor (**[**The Onion Router**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor\_\(network\))**) Network:**

* _Advantages:_ Offers better privacy than VPNs.
* _Disadvantages:_ Lower communication efficiency than VPNs due to passing through more nodes, each requiring encryption and decryption operations. The quality of communication in Tor is not guaranteed since all nodes are provided by volunteers, making it unsuitable for commercial applications. Specific communication protocols can be intercepted by network monitoring. Limited anonymity for internet service providers through expanded technology.

[**Decentralized VPN**](https://clearvpn.com/blog/dvpn-vs-vpn/) **(dVPN):**

* A decentralized VPN service provider incentivized by blockchain mechanisms inherits both the advantages and disadvantages of VPNs. The proof-of-work mechanism encourages participants to provide high-quality services, but it poses a de-anonymization risk to users. Users achieve better anonymity through anonymous payments.

**Mixed Network (**[**NYM**](https://nymtech.net/)**):**

* _Advantages:_ Provides better privacy than VPNs and Tor. A fully decentralized mixed network with a proof-of-work mechanism similar to Tor. Users can send all traffic through random node IP addresses via the mixed network.
* _Disadvantages:_ Specific communication protocols can be intercepted by network monitoring. Additional proof-of-work mechanisms increase usage costs and may introduce de-anonymization risks for users. Provides limited anonymity for internet service providers through expanded technology.
