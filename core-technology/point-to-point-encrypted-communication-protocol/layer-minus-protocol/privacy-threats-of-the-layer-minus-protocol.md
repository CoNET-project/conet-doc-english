# Privacy Threats of the Layer Minus Protocol

Layer Minus network has significantly altered the three essential elements in communication: sender address, recipient address, and content. It completely conceals the sender's address, reducing the amount of information that monitoring entities can access in network communication. However, there are still potential risks:

1.

    1. **Sender Address Concealment:**
       * **Issue:** The Layer Minus protocol conceals the sender's address, which could potentially be exploited by malicious actors for improper activities as the sender cannot be traced.
       * **Solution:** Balancing anonymity and preventing abuse may involve introducing some form of identity verification or monitoring mechanisms.
    2. **Privacy Leakage due to Colluding Nodes:**
       * **Issue:** Despite CONET using HTML short links, collusion among nodes may still lead to the correlation of IP addresses and wallet addresses, increasing the risk of user de-anonymization.
       * **Solution:** Elevating the criteria for node selection by choosing those trusted by the community and possessing higher reliability.
    3. **De-anonymization Risk in Payment Behavior:**
       * **Issue:** Through big data analysis, payment habits of users may be revealed, posing a threat to de-anonymizing user identities.
       * **Solution:** Encouraging users to use multiple unrelated wallets for payments to reduce the risk of tracking payment behavior.
    4. **Obstruction by IP Address Filtering:**
       * **Issue:** Some countries might block access to the CONET Layer Minus network through IP address filtering, affecting user accessibility.
       * **Solution:** Improving the global availability of CONET by increasing participation to counteract IP address filtering.

    In summary, the Layer Minus protocol needs to find a balance between privacy protection and preventing misuse. Continuous improvement and adjustments may be necessary to maintain this delicate balance.
