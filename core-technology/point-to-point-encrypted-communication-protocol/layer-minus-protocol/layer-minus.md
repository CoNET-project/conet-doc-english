# Layer Minus

**Layer Minus Protocol in CONET**

The Layer Minus protocol establishes a network protocol for peer-to-peer communication, using wallet addresses as unique identifiers to distinguish devices from each other. This protocol outlines how data should be encapsulated, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at its destination in a peer-to-peer communication network. The use of wallet addresses as unique identifiers ensures a secure and efficient means of communication within the CONET ecosystem.
