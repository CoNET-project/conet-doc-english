description: A new internet with enhanced privacy at the bottom of the web

# Features

Today, the internet is forced to enter Web3 because the major tech companies that have profited greatly from Web2 no longer prioritize user interests. They share customer privacy, target ads precisely, censor and delete user-generated content, and arbitrarily terminate users' social lives.

The concept of network privacy protection has been discussed and implemented for over 20 years, but instead of improving, it has faced even greater setbacks with the development of big data, AI, and censorship technologies.

If Web3 relies too much on the key infrastructure of Web2, it may become nothing more than an empty slogan. Rebuilding all internet hardware and software infrastructure from scratch is not practically possible. The CONET project plays a pivotal role in utilizing existing infrastructure to the maximum extent and fulfilling the vision of Web3.

**Open Zero-Trust Network Platform:** CONET assumes that all participants have the motivation to eavesdrop on communication content under collusion. It combines the WebAssembly (Wasm) memory-safe sandbox execution environment to provide an open, zero-trust, decentralized cloud computing platform.

**CONET Network as "Servers," Independent Users, and Business Users as Clients:** In CONET, both independent users and business users are considered clients relative to the CONET network. Clients send requests, and the CONET network responds to client requests. This design structure gives CONET users (including clients and servers) maximum agency and flexibility.

**Naturally Anonymous Wallet Addresses:** Wallet addresses generated through cryptography allow users to discard anonymized wallet addresses as needed. Wallet addresses are also infinite resources and do not rely on a centralized issuing institution.

**Naturally Anonymous Servers:** Seamlessly connects to the traditional client-server (CS) model of the internet. Servers accept signed request data from clients through wallet addresses, preserving server anonymity while obtaining undeniable client identity verification. With a decentralized domain name resolution system, it supports the transformation of readable domain names into wallet addresses.

**Non-Login Client-Server Model:** Clients send signed requests to servers, and servers, upon receiving the request, use cryptographic signatures for undeniable identification, establishing a system for identity verification through wallet addresses without traditional Web2 client login procedures.

**Sender Address Concealment:** CONET network uses encrypted data packets without metadata. One of the three major communication elements, the sender's address, is only obtainable by the recipient with the key through decrypting the ciphertext. In the forwarding process, nodes do not require encryption and decryption operations.

**Decentralized Routing Table:** Destination wallet addresses are written directly into smart contracts, avoiding the inefficient routing broadcast mechanism.

**Data Caching Mechanism:** Clients can delegate proxy nodes to cache offline data, addressing the pain point of offline data loss in peer-to-peer networks.

**Programmable Decentralized Cloud Computing Network:** The SaaS mechanism of node SaaS, through expanding plugins, continuously provides novel functionalities. The CONET network-developed Web2 bridge proxy is a typical SaaS case of CONET.

**CONET Network Resources as Collateral for Decentralized Stablecoins:** As the number of CONET participants increases, the settlement token becomes a form of service commitment promissory note. Its actual value closely follows the market price of cloud computing, possessing relatively stable pricing attributes. All CONET nodes, by pledging promissory notes, unconditionally redeem the services promised by the promissory notes. The overall network bandwidth, computational resources, and storage capacity of CONET form a powerful pledge for decentralized stablecoins, avoiding the death spiral of self-pledging and decentralized stablecoin algorithms. CONET's decentralized stablecoin makes a significant contribution to the decentralization process of the crypto industry.
