## **Silent Pass VPN vs. Silent Pass Proxy**

Silent Pass offers **two solutions** for decentralized privacy and security:

* **Silent Pass VPN**: A full-device protection tool that encrypts all internet traffic without requiring manual setup.
* **Silent Pass Proxy**: A targeted privacy solution for pc that allows users to route specific applications through a decentralized network.

Both versions operate on **CoNET’s Layer Minus Protocol**, ensuring **wallet-based communication with no IP tracking, no centralized logs, and true anonymity**.

### **Silent Pass VPN – Full-Device Privacy**

Silent Pass VPN is a **complete privacy solution** that encrypts all traffic on a device. It requires **no manual configurations**, providing instant security with **one-click connectivity**.

**Key Features:**

* **Full-device encryption** – Protects all network traffic across the operating system.
* **One-click connection** – No need for proxy settings or additional configuration.
* **Multi-hop routing** – Automatically routes traffic through multiple decentralized nodes for added security.
* **No identifiable IPs or centralized logs** – Ensures complete anonymity.
* **Ideal for mobile users** and those needing privacy across all applications.

**Setup:**

* Download and install **Silent Pass VPN** (currently available for **Mac and iOS**, with **Windows and Android** versions coming soon).
* Open the app and connect with **one click**.
* The entire device’s internet traffic is now encrypted and decentralized.

### **Silent Pass Proxy – Selective App-Based Privacy**

Silent Pass Proxy is a **PC-only solution** that encrypts traffic **for specific applications** rather than the entire device. Unlike the VPN, the Proxy requires **Silent Pass Daemon to function**, and users can either manually configure settings or use the browser extension for automatic setup.

**Key Features:**

* **Protects selected applications** – Unlike a VPN, Silent Pass Proxy does not encrypt all traffic by default.
* **Runs through Silent Pass Daemon** – The daemon is required for proxy operation.
* **Browser extension for auto-configuration** – No need for manual proxy setup when using supported browsers.
* **Manual proxy settings** – Users can configure proxy settings for specific apps as needed.

**Setup:**

1. **Download and install Silent Pass Daemon** – Required to run Silent Pass Proxy.
2. **Choose your configuration method:**
   * **For browser-only protection:** Install the Silent Pass browser extension (works with Chrome and Chromium-based browsers). This will **automatically configure** proxy settings.
   * **For manual app selection:** Configure proxy settings and specific applications to route them through Silent Pass.

### **Evolution: From Silent Pass Proxy to Full VPN**

Silent Pass initially launched as a **Proxy solution**, enabling **app-based decentralized privacy** before evolving into a full VPN.

**Proxy Version (Initial Release):**

* Allowed early users to experience decentralized privacy.
* Required **Silent Pass Daemon** for operation.
* Provided flexibility to choose which applications used Silent Pass.

**VPN Version (Recent Release):**

* Delivers **full-device encryption** with no need for manual setup.
* Eliminates dependency on **app-specific configurations**.
* Supports **mobile and desktop platforms** for broader accessibility.

### **Which One Should You Use?**

✔ **Use Silent Pass VPN** if you want **full-device encryption** with a **simple one-click setup**.\
✔ **Use Silent Pass Proxy** if you have pc and need **selective privacy** for specific applications and are comfortable with manual proxy configurations.

By offering **both solutions**, Silent Pass ensures **flexibility in decentralized privacy**, catering to users who want **either full-device security or targeted encrypted routing**.
