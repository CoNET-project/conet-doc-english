## Revolutionizing Online Privacy with Blockchain&#x20;

In today’s digital world, centralized VPNs expose users to data tracking, censorship, and security risks. They rely on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to breaches and surveillance. Silent Pass rewrites the rules of online privacy by leveraging CoNET’s Layer Minus Protocol, eliminating IP tracking, enabling wallet-based communication, and ensuring a truly decentralized VPN experience.

### **Why Silent Pass?**

* **True Anonymity** – No IP tracking, no centralized logs.
* **High-Speed, Decentralized Routing** – Lightning-fast connections with multi-hop obfuscation.
* **Mining & Earning** – Contribute to CoNET’s network while browsing and earn $CONET.
* **Borderless Access** – Bypass regional restrictions with seamless global connectivity.
* **Decentralized Architecture** – No single point of failure, ensuring privacy protection.
* **No Registration Required** – Start using Silent Pass without email, phone number, or personal data.
* **Open Source -**  [https://github.com/CoNET-project/SilentPass-iOS](https://github.com/CoNET-project/SilentPass-iOS)



## **Silent Pass Technology: How It Works**

Silent Pass eliminates centralized control by routing traffic through CoNET’s decentralized nodes, ensuring untraceable communication, enhanced security, and censorship resistance.

### **1. Wallet-Based Routing – The End of IP Tracking**

Silent Pass replaces IP-based routing with wallet address-based communication, powered by CoNET’s Layer Minus Protocol.

**Why It Matters**

* Untraceable traffic with no IP logs or metadata storage.
* Decentralized routing ensures no single entity controls user traffic.
* Eliminates centralized servers, reducing surveillance risks.

**How It Works**

* When a user connects, Silent Pass assigns a temporary session key linked to a wallet address instead of an IP.
* Requests are encrypted and fragmented, then relayed through multiple independent nodes.
* No single node has access to the full browsing activity, ensuring total anonymity.

### **2. Multi-Hop Encryption – Strengthening Security**

Silent Pass automatically applies multi-hop encryption, routing traffic through multiple decentralized nodes before reaching its destination.

**Why It Matters**

* Each hop adds a new encryption layer, preventing tracking.
* Dynamic pathing ensures constantly changing routes, making surveillance ineffective.
* Even if one node is compromised, the full traffic flow cannot be reconstructed.

**How It Works**

* Each request is encrypted multiple times before leaving the user’s device.
* The request travels through multiple relay nodes, with each node decrypting only the previous hop.
* The final node decrypts the last layer and delivers the request, preventing any single point of surveillance.

**Advantage Over Traditional VPNs**

Traditional VPNs send all traffic through a single exit node, which can be monitored. Silent Pass dynamically distributes traffic, making monitoring impossible.

### **3. Fragmented Data Transmission – Breaking Down Data for Maximum Privacy**

Silent Pass does not just encrypt traffic—it splits it into fragments and sends them through separate network paths.

**Why It Matters**

* No single node can reconstruct user activity, preventing data correlation.
* Stops metadata tracking, preventing surveillance tools from inferring behavior.
* If a node fails, traffic still reaches its destination via alternative paths.

**How It Works**

* Requests are broken into encrypted fragments.
* Each fragment is routed separately through decentralized nodes.
* At the destination, fragments are reassembled, ensuring complete privacy.

**Comparison with Traditional VPNs**

### **4. Zero-Log Policy – Absolute Data Privacy**

Silent Pass follows a true zero-log policy, ensuring no user data is stored, processed, or accessible.

**How It Works**

* Silent Pass does not track or store IP addresses.
* No browsing history, timestamps, or connection data are recorded.
* No entity can monitor or collect user activity due to CoNET’s decentralized structure.
