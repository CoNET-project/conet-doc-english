## How CoNET Nodes Work, Consensus & Staking

CoNET operates on a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Staking (PoS), and Proof of Time (PoT) to create a scalable, decentralized, and privacy-first network.

* Proof of Staking (PoS): Users stake $CONET or $ETH to operate nodes, ensuring economic security and long-term commitment.
* Proof of Time (PoT): Active participation and uptime contribute to additional rewards, incentivizing users to keep their nodes online.
* ‚Ä¢ Proof of Work (PoW): Nodes contribute computational resources to validate transactions and secure the network. In CoNET, PoW goes beyond transaction validation‚Äîit also ensures nodes remain online and connected, verifies social tasks, and supports decentralized applications by providing essential computational power.

By integrating Layer Minus Protocol, CoNET ensures a wallet-based validation system, eliminating IP tracking and reinforcing true decentralization and anonymity.

## Node Types & Their Roles in CoNET

### Validator Nodes: Securing the Blockchain & Earning ETH

How It Works

* Validator Nodes verify and process transactions on the CoNET blockchain, ensuring decentralization and security.
* They earn ETH rewards from network transaction fees.
* Validators participate in a staking pool, where 50% of transaction fees are distributed to Guardian NFT holders initially, with ETH staking opening after three months from mainnet launch.

How to Become a Validator

There are two ways to become a Validator:\
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hold a Guardian NFT ‚Üí Automatically receive Validator Node without staking.\
2Ô∏è‚É£ Stake and delegate ETH ‚Üí Users can delegate staking 3.2 ETH for a full Validator Node, or stake smaller amounts to receive a proportional share of rewards.

Staking & Rewards

How Validator Staking Works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Guardian NFT Holders automatically own 1 Validator Node per NFT.\
2Ô∏è‚É£ ETH Stakers can acquire Validator Node shares based on their staked amount:

* Staking 3.2 ETH = 1 Full Validator Node Share
* Staking 6.4 ETH = 2 Validator Node Share
* Staking 0.4 ETH = 1/8 Validator Node Share

Example Earnings Calculation:

If the reward pool distributes 5 ETH to Validators and the total active Validator Node shares are:

‚úÖ 1 Guardian NFT (1 Share)\
‚úÖ 1 User with 3.2 ETH Staked (1 Share)\
‚úÖ 1 User with 6.4 ETH Staked (2 Shares)\
‚úÖ 1 User with 0.4 ETH Staked (1/8 Share)

Total Validator Shares = 4.125

Each share earns: 5 ETH √∑ 4.125 = 1.2121 ETH per share

* üèÜ Guardian NFT Holder (1 Share) ‚Üí Earns 1.2121 ETH
* üèÜ Staker with 3.2 ETH (1 Share) ‚Üí Earns 1.2121 ETH
* üèÜ Staker with 6.4 ETH (2 Shares) ‚Üí Earns 2.4242 ETH
* üèÜ Staker with 0.4 ETH (1/8 Share) ‚Üí Earns 0.1515 ETH

Requirements

For Node Operators (Running a Validator Node):

* Guardian NFT Holders.
* Mandatory Cloud Node Service for 24/7 uptime.
* Hardware: 4-core CPU, 16GB RAM, storage based on network growth.

For Stakers (Delegating to Validator Nodes):

* No hardware or cloud service required‚Äîsimply delegate ETH to an existing Validator Node and earn rewards proportionally.

### Full Nodes: Powering the DePIN Network

How It Works

&#x20;  ‚Ä¢ Powering the Network: Full Nodes provide bandwidth, CPU, storage, and SaaS to support decentralized applications, ensuring fast and secure transactions.

* Enabling Privacy & Security: They play a key role in data communication, relaying Layer Minus Protocol by replacing IP addresses with wallet-based routing for enhanced privacy.
* DEX Integration: Full Nodes act as agents for order matching on the CoNET Decentralized Exchange (DEX), helping to facilitate seamless transactions.

Earnings

* Earn $CONET daily with an annual ROI of 43.2%.
* Earn ETH from order matching fees on DEX.

Requirements

* Staking: 5,000 $CONET ($500 at presale price), locked for 1 year.
* Price Fixed in USD ‚Üí The required stake amount remains $500 in value following presale price, adjusting for token price changes.
* Cloud Node Service Required (self-hosted nodes failing to maintain stable connection 24/7 will be blacklisted). Cloud node can be paid with $CONET.
* Hardware: 2-core CPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB storage.

### Partial Nodes: Flexible Resource Sharing

How It Works

* Contributes bandwidth, CPU, and storage to the network.
* Validates social tasks and SaaS computations.

Important Participation Rules

* First hour after connecting: Volunteer mode to ensure node operators take their role seriously and maintain stable network conditions.&#x20;
* Users who fail to stay online consistently will have lower priority for mining rewards.
* Cloud Nodes are recommended for 24/7 uptime to ensure stable mining rewards. Cloud node can be paid with $CONET.

Earnings

* Earn $CONET with an annual ROI of 28.8%.
* Only mines when online, the longer you stay connected, the more you earn.

Requirements

* Staking: 1,000 $CONET ($100 at presale price), locked for 180 days.
* Price Fixed in USD ‚Üí The required stake amount remains $100 in value following presale price, adjusting for token price changes.
* Cloud Node Recommended for 24/7 uptime.
* Hardware: 2-core CPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB storage.

### Light Node: Free Mining for Silent Pass Premium Users

&#x20;How It Works:

* Light Nodes require no staking and are exclusive to Silent Pass VPN Premium Users.
* They contribute to Proof of Work, Proof of Connection, and Proof of Time, supporting CoNET‚Äôs decentralized network.
* Runs directly from a web browser‚Äîno technical setup needed!

&#x20;Earnings:

* Earn $CONET with an annual ROI of 12% (subject to adjustment).

&#x20;Requirements:

* No staking required‚Äîexclusive for Silent Pass Premium Users.
* Runs on a web browser‚Äîno additional hardware required.

Online: The longer it stays connected, the more $CONET it earns.
