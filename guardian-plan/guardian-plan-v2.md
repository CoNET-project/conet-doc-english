# Guardian Plan V2

## **Introducing the Enhanced Guardian Plan V2**

The Guardian Plan remains a cornerstone of the CoNET ecosystem, offering you the chance to actively participate in the evolution of a secure and decentralized Internet. As a Guardian, you are a vital player, contributing to the network’s governance, stability, and growth.

With the launch of the upgraded Guardian Plan V2, we're adding new benefits and features, enhancing your role and increasing your earning potential within our community. This next phase brings more opportunities for Guardians to earn and gain rewards both before and after the Token Generation Event (TGE), while continuing to play a key part in the future of decentralized infrastructure.

\
Let's dive deeper into the benefits and features of the Guardian Plan V2:\


### **Before TGE (Token Generation Event):**

Guardian SuperNode Mining 24/7: As a Guardian, your SuperNode will mine CNTP continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and join a larger CNTP reward pool. This means you’ll be earning rewards around the clock, with a greater share of the daily pool than regular miners.

\


**Free Usage of Silent Pass:** Enjoy total online privacy with free access to Silent Pass, CoNET's decentralized VPN. Silent Pass leverages our Layer Minus Protocol to replace IP addresses with wallet addresses, ensuring secure and private browsing.

\


**10% USDT Rewards for Referrals and Additional Purchases:** Earn a 10% USDT bonus by referring new Guardians or purchasing more than one Guardian Plan. This program rewards you for helping grow the community and expanding your support for the project.

\


**Free Power Card:** Receive a Power Card at no cost, enhancing your mining capabilities and maximizing your earnings potential in the CoNET network. The Power Card boosts your node's performance, allowing you to mine more effectively and includes a privacy tool and hardware wallet functionality.

\


### **After TGE (Token Generation Event):**

**Free Usage of CoNET dApps:** After TGE, Guardians will enjoy free access to all CoNET decentralized applications (dApps), enabling seamless participation in our ecosystem without additional costs.

\


**Revenue Sharing:** As a Guardian, you will directly benefit from the network’s growth. You’ll receive a share of the revenue generated from CoNET’s dApps and network services, providing a steady income stream as the platform expands.

\


**Extra Airdrop Allocation:** Post-TGE, Guardians receive an increased allocation of airdropped tokens, giving you more CNTP to convert in to $CONET token.

\


**Guardian Node Functions:** The Guardian Plan now includes both Validator and Full Node functions, offering multiple ways to earn:

\


**-Validator Node without Staking:** Your Guardian Node will act as a Validator, confirming transactions and securing the blockchain. You will earn fees from transaction validations without needing to stake additional tokens.

**-Full Node without Staking:** Operate as a Full Node, mining sharing your bandwidth and CPU to support the network’s infrastructure. Earn rewards for your contributions without any staking requirements, promoting greater network decentralization.

\


_**Important Update:**_

Given the enhanced benefits and earnings opportunities, please note that the repurchase program for Guardian Plans will not be available for purchases made after 15 September 2024.&#x20;

This adjustment reflects the added value provided to Guardians.&#x20;

The repurchase program remains valid for all Guardian Plans purchased before this date.
